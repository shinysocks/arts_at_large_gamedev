>* brainstorm final game ideas
>  * bring in their favorite games, how can we combine different aspects?
>  * 
>* agree on main idea / understand everything that must be done to complete
>  * what assets need to be created by other teams / people?

>### Questions
>* ONE Deliverable or multiple per student?
>* How much programming should be taught vs done by me?
>* Animation is crucial but I don't know how to do animation...?
>* What resources / budget do I have?
